# Non-Overlapping-Circles
A simple Java program that creates a window and draws 100 non overlapping circles that are all different from each other (except their color). The number of circles to be drawn can be changed by updating the variable "N" in the Main. The program uses StdDraw library to draw circles. Do not forget to add it to the project.

Example:
